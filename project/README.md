# Exercise 1

In this exercise, you will practice using `fetch()` and promises to download and display music previews from a web API (specifically, the [iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/)):

![Example complete exercise](img/example.png)

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments. Note that you ___WILL___ need to edit the HTML file to include the polyfills so that your script will work on Internet Explorer. If you would like to use `jQuery` for _DOM Manipulation_ (**not** for requesting data), make sure to include it in the `index.html` file.

You can see the results of your work by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser. Remember to refresh the page after you update your code, and to check for any errors in the Developer console.

## Testing
This exercise includes a test suite to verify that modified DOM is correct. Note that this test is simply to help you verify your results; it will not ensure that your code follows the required syntactical approach.

You can run the test suite using

```bash
jest exercise-1
```
